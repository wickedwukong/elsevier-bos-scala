* Introduce Monad concept using the Monad trait
* Explain F[_] means:

  F is a type constructor. You can fill in the hole with a type to produce another type.
  e.g List is a type constructor. List[Int] or List[A] is a type

  Show the IOMonad again

2. Introduce Monad law:

  1. Left identity:(pure(a) flatMapf) == f(a)
  2. Right identity:(m flatMap pure)==m
  3. Associativity: (m flatMap f flatMap g) == (m flatMap (x => f(x) flatMap g))

3. Checkout built-in-monad
   Give a few monad examples from the standard scala lib
   Option, List

4. Checkout monad-map-exercise

   Exercise: use pure and flatMap to implement map

5. Checkout monad-map-solution

   show the solution

6. checkout maybe-exercise

   Ask audience to implement the Maybe


7. Checkout out maybe-solution
   Demo the solution and ask audience how to implement the map to make the for comprehension work.
   Use intellij to de-sugar the for comprehension to highlight it is actually flatMap and map.

8. Checkout maybe-for
   Show the audience the implementation of the map to show how the for comprehension works.

9. Checkout popular-monads.

* Explain Scalaz \/ and Cats Xor as monad examples and also show Scala standard Either. Highlights Either is not a monad
  and it is not biased.
* Show writer monad.

Writer is a monad that lets us carry a log along with a computation. We can use it to record
messages, errors, or additional data about a computation, and extract the log with the final result.

One common use for Writers is logging during multi-threaded computa ons, where traditional logging can
result in interleaved messages from different contexts. With a Writer the log for the computation on is tied to the result,
so we can run concurrent computation without mixing log messages.
