* Introduce Monad concept using the Monad trait
* Explain F[_] means:

  F is a type constructor. You can fill in the hole with a type to produce another type.
  e.g List is a type constructor. List[Int] or List[A] is a type


  In Scala we declare type constructors using underscores but refer to them without:
  // Declare F using underscores:
  def myMethod[F[_]] = {
   // Refer to F without underscores:
    val functor = Functor.apply[F] // ...
  }

  Use TypeConstructor.scala to show this.
